/*
Joint Savings Account
---------------------

To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, you will create a solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses that are then able to control a joint savings account. Your smart contract will use ether management functions to implement various requirements from the financial institution to provide the features of the joint savings account.

The Starting file provided for this challenge contains a `pragma` for solidity version `5.0.0`.
You will do the following:

1. Create and work within a local blockchain development environment using the JavaScript VM provided by the Remix IDE.

2. Script and deploy a **JointSavings** smart contract.

3. Interact with your deployed smart contract to transfer and withdraw funds.
